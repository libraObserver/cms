### Analyze, choose, and justify the appropriate resource option for deploying the app.

*For **both** a VM or App Service solution for the CMS app:*
- *Analyze costs, scalability, availability, and workflow*
- *Choose the appropriate solution (VM or App Service) for deploying the app*
- *Justify your choice*

APP SERVICE: A CMS app that is launched through an App Service has
acceptable prices, scalability, and availability. About the price, App Service is absolutely win VM in this small project since it have 3 tier base on project purpuse, and i will choose development and testing for optimse the price; provide high availability and auto-scaling, both vertical and horizontal scaling. Because of how little this software is, it doesn't require a lot of processing power. The lower compute requirements of a CMS software are therefore not expensive, even though the service plans are continuous and the customer is paying even when no one is using the service. The Azure portal's continuous deployment through GitHub workflows makes updating the CMS app a breeze.

VM: For a CMS app delivered through a VM, the pricing, scalability, and availability are also affordable. The price of VM base on instances and number of them running per hour; the scalability is autoscaling with virtual machine sclase sets, with limitatino is depend on platform image, 1000 nodes per scale set, or custom image, 600 nodes per scale set. The VM enables additional capabilities customization for the app. It also would really benefit developers who have already built a CMS app but it might not be supported through App Service but could work through the VM workflow. It also allows for more fine-tuning, so the developer can customize the VM to optimize their CMS app.

For me, The CMS app is lightweight, doesn't require a lot of compute power, and is simple to deploy through Azure, so I went with App Service. Python code is used by the CMS App, which is supported by App Service.

### Assess app changes that would change your decision.

*Detail how the app and any other needs would have to change for you to change your decision in the last section.*

Alternatively, we can choose Virtual machine to deploy. If i choose VM for the CSM Article, first we need to create the environment inside the VM, and install all the library as well set up some file for flask to run the app. It would cost more if it gains popularity since it needs more hardware and processing power. It will take a little longer to onboard new developers because they need to understand how the VM has been configured. Additionally, the CMS might become substantially more expensive if it required additional computational power.
